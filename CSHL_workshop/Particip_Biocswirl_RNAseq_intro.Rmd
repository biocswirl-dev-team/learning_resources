# Part 1: Intro to R

## What is R and what is R markdown?

-   R is an open sourced statistical programming language based on an older proprietary language known as S.

-   R contains various add ons known as packages. Think of these like additional apps on that you download on top of the base apps you get on your phone.

-   We will go over the basics of syntax within R.

But first, let's talk about the document we are currently working in. Think of it as a like a notebook for your code that includes comments and I find it's easier to keep track of your analysis.

I recommend using **r markdown files** for all of your analysis scripts.

In `.rmd` files, code needs to be in code chunks (insert code chunk shortcut is Windows: `ctrl` `+` `alt` `+` `i`, Mac: `cmd` `+` `alt` `+` `i`) in order to run.

```{r}

```

In an R markdown you can knit a file into various formats for nice reports.

## Data Types: Vector

In R, the basic data structure is known as a vector. Vectors are divided into various categories.

A few of the basic categories are listed below:

 Use Windows: `ctrl` `+`enter`, Mac:`cmd` + `enter` to run a single line of the code chunk. If there is multiple lines of code you can run the entire chunk using the play button (green triangle) on the code chunk. 

```{r}
3.14 # This is a numeric vector
"This is a character" # A character vector
"3.14" # This is also a character vector
TRUE # logical vector
FALSE # also logical
```


```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN(3.14)
```

What if we wanted to use a value again?

We can store it as an object.

An object is assigned through the `<-`operator. A vector can have more than 1 object.

Use `alt`+ `-` (Windows) or `option`+ `-`(Mac) for the `<-` operator.

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- FILL_THIS_IN #store multiple values of 1 type

```

However, a vector contains only 1 type of data. So if you tried this. What do you think would happen?

```{r}
z <- FILL_THIS_IN
z
```

It coerces the 1 into a character vector.

Vectors are 1 dimensional and you can look at various properties of a vector like length.

```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN(y)
```

To get the second element in a vector you use `[]`

```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN
```

## Matrix

Multiple objects are stored in a matrix. Like a vector, a matrix only contains 1 type of data, but it has more than 1 dimension.

Matrix is a common data object in many types of bioinformatic analyses.

```{r}
matx <- FILL_THIS_IN(data=1:9,nrow=3,ncol=3)
matx
```

You can also create a vector like this:

```{r}
mat2 <- FILL_THIS_IN(y,z)
mat2
class(mat2)
```

Use [row,column] to access elements of a matrix

```{r}
matx[FILL_THIS_IN] # Access the 3rd element of the first row
matx[FILL_THIS_IN] # Access the first row
matx[FILL_THIS_IN] # access the first column
```

You can even name the rows and columns of a matrix.

```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN(matx) <- c("Earth","Venus","Mars") #name rows
FILL_THIS_IN(matx) <- c("A","B","C") # name columns
matx
```

## Data frames

A data.frame is basically just a table. It has a certain number of rows, and a certain number of columns. It's a special type of data object and various operations can be performed on data frames.

"trees" is a built-in dataset in R available as a `data.frame`.

```{r}
trees
```

The columns of the trees `data.frame` object are individual `vector` objects. So trees has 3 columns/vectors that are each 31 elements long. The dbl is just a type of numeric class of data.

Another Example of a data.frame. The ToothGrowth dataset looking at hamster teeth grown with different supplements and doses of Vitamin C.

```{r}
ToothGrowth
```

Here the len is a factor which is a special data type that stores the character vector as a special object behind the scenes.

Data Frames, unlike a matrix, can contain many different types of data like dates, characters, numbers.

You can create a dataframe like this.

```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN("A"=1:2,B=c("A","B"))
```

### Some basic functions to help understand your `data.frame` objects are:

```{r,error=TRUE}
# number of rows
FILL_THIS_IN(trees)
# number of columns
FILL_THIS_IN(trees)
# row x columns
FILL_THIS_IN(trees)
# some basic info on the "structure" of the data.frame
FILL_THIS_IN(trees)
# calculates some summary statistics on each column
FILL_THIS_IN(trees)
# print first 6 rows
FILL_THIS_IN(trees)
# print last 6 rows
FILL_THIS_IN(trees)
## What type of data is trees?
FILL_THIS_IN(trees) 
```

In base R (without additional packages), we can subset the dataframe, similar to how we subset a matrix.

```{r}
treesFILL_THIS_IN # gets the first row
```

```{r}
treesFILL_THIS_IN ## gets the value of the first column and the first row
treesFILL_THIS_IN # first column, returns a dataframe
```

However we can also call the named column using `$`. For example if we wanted the Height column. This will drop the name and return a numeric vector.

```{r}
treesFILL_THIS_IN
FILL_THIS_IN(treesFILL_THIS_IN) # checks the class of the height column
```

These differences in subsetting return different objects so think about what output you want.

## Basic operations in R

See knitted html for pretty tables.

**Arithmetic** operators allow us to carry out mathematical operations:

| Operator | Description                       |
|----------|:----------------------------------|
| \+       | Add                               |
| \-       | Subtract                          |
| \*       | Multiply                          |
| /        | Divide                            |
| \^       | Exponent                          |
| %%       | Modulus (remainder from division) |

**Relational** operators allow us to compare values:

| Operator | Description              |
|----------|:-------------------------|
| \<       | Less than                |
| \>       | Greater than             |
| \<=      | Less than or equal to    |
| \>=      | Greater than or equal to |
| ==       | Equal to                 |
| !=       | Not equal to             |

-   Arithmetic and relational operators work on vectors.

**Logical** operators allow us to carry out boolean operations:

| Operator | Description        |
|----------|:-------------------|
| !        | Not                |
| \|       | Or (element_wise)  |
| &        | And (element-wise) |
| \|\|     | Or                 |
| &&       | And                |

The vector `a` is created for you using the values 1,2,3. Create a second vector `b` with the values 4,6,8

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3)
FILL_THIS_IN
```

Add and subtract the 2 vectors. Try another arithmetic operation from the list above.

```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN
FILL_THIS_IN
```

How would you check if 5 is greater than 7? How would you check if 5+2 is the same as 2+5

```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN
FILL_THIS_IN
```

Let's bind a and b into a matrix called c.

```{r}
c <- FILL_THIS_IN
```

How would you do the following

```{r}
FILL_THIS_IN ## select elements greater than 3
FILL_THIS_IN ## select elements greater than 3 or equal to 1 
```

## Where to get help?

R like any language can be confusing at times. It's okay if you get stuck.

If you are confused about how to do something or what to do next follow these steps below:

1.  Read the error message (if there is one). Error messages often times help convey what you might have missed.
2.  Check your code for simple mistakes. Did you miss a bracket or quotation mark, did you misspell an object name or use `=` instead of `==`?
3.  Read the function documentation. Use the `?` command to pull up the help page.

-   Check the inputs the function needs (a `data.frame` vs a `matrix`)

4.  Copy and paste the error message and name of function into **Google**

### Importantly for Point 4, always accredit the code you use

If you used stackoverflow or any other website use code comments like \# or a comment before the code chunk to accredit the webite

Ex.

Code from www.helpfulwebsite.fakename.com/user1/howto

```{r}
1+1 #www.helpfulwebsite.fakename.com/user1/howto
```
