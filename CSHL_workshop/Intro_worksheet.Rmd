## Accreditation

Adapted from the following resources:

-   Data Wrangling workshop for the BC Children's Trainee Omics Group (TOG) by Almas Khan
-   Also Adapted from Tutorials of Victor Yuan for the BC Children's TOG.
-   [Perdue's Intro to R](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/bigtap/online/docs/Introduction_to_R_and_Bioconductor.html)
## About

- Authors of this script: Almas Khan and Julia Phillip

- Visit BiocSwirl's Twitter page for more updates on our project. 

## Setup

-   Please have the latest version of R and Rstudio installed.

-   Download the [r markdown file]() for this workshop and open it in Rstudio.

-   Install the following R packages now, if you haven't already:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages(c("Bioconductor","swirl"))
### Add swirl Installation
```

## Overall Learning outcomes

-   Knowledge of R and Bioconductor

-   Knowledge of basic R data types

-   Differentiate a matrix and data.frame

-   Understanding how to :

    -   Assign variables
    -   Run built in operations in R
    -   Subset on a data.frame and matrix

<!---The following chunk allows errors when knitting--->

```{r allow errors, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

## Topics

## Part 1: Intro to R:

**What is R?**

-   What are vectors?

    -   Basic data types

-   `data.frame` and `matrix` objects

    -   Basic functions for exploring dataframes
    -   Basic functions for matrices
    -   Indexing and Subsetting

### Part 2: Bioconductor and RNAseq

**What is Bioconductor?**

-   Introduction

**What is BiocSwirl**

-   Introduction
-   Notes and topics

## What is R and what is R markdownn? 

- R is an open sourced statistical programming language based on an older propietary language known as S. 
- R contains various add ons known as packages. Think of these like additional apps on that you download onto your phone.  
- We will go over the basics of syntax within R. 

But first, let's talk about the document we are currently working in. Think of it as a like a notebook for your code that includes comments and I find it's easier to keep track of your analysis.

I recommend using **r markdown files** for all of your analysis scripts. 

In `.rmd` files, code needs to be in code chunks (insert code chunk shortcut is Windows: `ctrl` `+` `alt` `+` `i`, Mac: `cmd` `+` `alt` `+` `i`) in order to run.

```{r}

```

In an R markdown you can knit a file into various formats for nice reports. 

### Data Types

In R, data is divided into various categories. 

A few of the basic categories are listed below: 

```{r}
3.14 # This is a numeric 
"This is a character" # A character type 
"3.14" # This is also a character 
TRUE # logical
FALSE # These are logicals
```
These different types of data are stored in objects known as vectors. 

## Data frames and matrices

A data.frame is basically just a table, it has a certain number of rows, and a certain number of columns.

"trees" is a built-in dataset in R available as a `data.frame`.

```{r}
trees
```

The columns of the trees `data.frame` object are individual `vector` objects. So trees has 3 columns/vectors that are each 31 elements long. The dbl is just a type of numeric class of data.

### Some basic functions to help understand your `data.frame` objects are:

```{r,error=TRUE}
# number of rows
nrow(trees)
# number of columns
ncol(trees)
# row x columns
dim(trees)
# some basic info on the "structure" of the data.frame
str(trees)
# calculates some summary statistics on each column
summary(trees)
# print first 6 rows
head(trees)
# print last 6 rows
tail(trees)
```

## Accreditation

The BiocSwirl interactive course was based on [this RNA-seq workflow](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqGene/inst/doc/rnaseqGene.html) published by Love et al., updated in 2019.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# installation of devtools
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
# installation of biocswirl with vignettes
devtools::install_github("biocswirl-dev-team/BiocSwirl", build_vignettes = TRUE)
# load Biocswirl library
library(BiocSwirl)
# load swirl
library(swirl)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# list all available courses
list_courses()
# select the RNAseq course for installation
load_course('RNAseq')
# start the BiocSwirl course environment
start_course()
```

These following commands can be used within the BiocSwirl course environment.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bye() #exits the course environment
play() #suspends feedback, allows you to ‘play’ with code
nxt() #continue feedback
skip() # skips question, not recommended
```
